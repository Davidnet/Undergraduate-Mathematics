\chapter{Introduction to Mathematics}
First, a word about sets. These are the most primitive objects in mathematics. We use the following observation by Cantor

\epigraph{By an aggregate [set] we are to understand any collection into a whole M of definite and separate objects m of our intution or our thought. These objects we call the elements of M}{\textit{Cantor}}

We start with an informal definition of Natural numbers, recall that we can put this in stone observations, using the Peano axioms

\chapter{Linear Algebra}

A vector space $V$ over a filed $\mathbb{f}$ is an abelian group $(V,+)$, for which a binary product, $(a,v) \rightarrow av$, of $ \mathbb{f} \times V$ into $V$ is defined satisfying the following axioms for all $a,b \in \mathbb{F}$ and $u,v \in V$

\begin{itemize}
    \item $1v = v$
    \item $(ab)v = a(bv) $
    \item $(a + b)v = av + bv$ and $a(v+u) = av + au$
\end{itemize}
